To install the XenClient tools for Linux, open a terminal window, change
to this directory and execute:

 $ sudo ./install.sh

The various PV drivers can be excluded from the install using the following:

 $ sudo XC_TOOLS_EXCLUDE=vusb,v4v ./install.sh

This would prevent both the vusb and v4v PV drivers from being insalled.

Possible values for XC_TOOLS_EXCLUDE: v4v xenmou vusb
